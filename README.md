# web2-a2


#This is the content of my Web2 Assessment 2 assignment. You can open two terminals. One terminal should be on the homepage and input "node server.js" to start the front-end. The other terminal should be in the "api" folder and input "node index.js" to start the back-end. In this way, the project can be launched.
